This repository presents to examples with a basic implementation of the UNIFAC thermodynamic model to calculate activity coefficients. 

The first one is from the book "Introduction to thermodynamics in Chemical Engineering" 5th edition fron Smith, Van Ness and Abbott, in the Annex G.
This example is an implementation using molar compositions, for the system diethylamine/n-heptane.

The second example is an implementation of the UNIFAC thermodynamic model in mass compositions to calculate the activity coefficients for 
experiment 23 from Table 1 in Reference from from Noriega et al 2019 paper "UNIFAC correlated parameters for liquid-liquid equilibrium prediction of ternary systems related to biodiesel production process"

Finally there is an optimizied implementation of the UNIFAC model using numpy.
